Can you control your dreams?
Some people think writing your dreams down can open your mind to lucid dreaming. Lucid dreams are dreams where you are not only aware you are dreaming but you can make decisions to affect the events of your dreams. So, maybe you can turn a nightmare into a safe-feeling dream, or you can direct the plot of your dream like a film director. Then, instead of just working out the meaning of your dreams, you will be creating them, though you might want to continue having some dreams that allow your subconscious to tell you what is on your mind!
